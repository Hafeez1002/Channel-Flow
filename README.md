I’ve always been fascinated by the concept of channel flow. It’s like watching a river flow, but there’s so much more to it than meets the eye.

I noticed that the water doesn’t move at the same speed everywhere. 
It’s faster in the middle and slower near the edges because it’s interacting with the riverbed and banks.
This variation, known as the “velocity profile”, intrigued me. 
I wanted to capture this complex behavior in code, to better understand and predict how fluids behave in different scenarios.
Then there’s the element of turbulence - those unpredictable swirls and eddies that add another layer of complexity. 
Turbulence can significantly impact how heat and other substances get transported by the flow. 
So, I decided to incorporate this aspect into my code as well.
